# Software Debouncing
This code helps prevent unnecesary button pressed due to button bouncing. This is accomplished using timers.

## How it works
A timer is used to detect a button state change. Once the button is pressed the timer runs and once the button settles it will perform an action

## What does it work with
This code works with the FR2311 and the G2553 with the differences being the timer name and some pin names
